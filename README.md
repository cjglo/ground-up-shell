# Ground-Up Shell
A Shell built in C without any external libraries.

## Current & Planned Features:

- [ ] [IN PROGRESS] Accepts file input with commands of arbitary length and creates processes to execute, then exits parent process
- [ ] Running commands from interactive user input
- [ ] Setting/retrieving environment variables
- [ ] Support for pipes (including stdin/stdout redirection)
- [ ] Built-in functionality that is often part of a *nix shell (such as implementations of common utilities like cd), other than what has been outlined above
- [ ] The ability to change directories or anything else of the like
- [ ] Quoting/escaping of characters in arguments/program names
- [ ] Running programs in the background
